# Reproduce The Turkey Happiness Index Map Using The ``ggplot2`` Library in R

## Overview
In this period, where the importance of data analysis and visualization is increasing, the use of spatial data has also gained importance depending on this trend. In particular, the graphical presentation of demographic issues, such as unemployment rate, migration rate, etc., can be shown as the place where spatial data is used most.
We will obtain a map chart and reproduce the research prepared by Misha Kollontai (https://rpubs.com/mkollontai/DATA607_TidyVerse) in this study by combining the happiness index data (https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/DownloadIstatistikselTablo?p=Qn8URGHZfT033SeIrJx2fdp2FgyEH2rBe1P6xJhJD/v/l6FkiKiNewG7BKpESzaN) by provinces in Turkey published by TUIK (Turkish Statistical Institute) in 2013 and the spatial data of Turkey obtained from the https://gadm.org/country site.

## Approach and Methodology
This project will include;

*	the libraries and codes used in the visualization process of a data set on the R Studio platform, mainly ``ggplot2``

## Objectives
Our aim in this project is to document how we can apply the methods in ``R`` programming for Reproducible Research course while examining a data set and comparing the conclusions with this research.
